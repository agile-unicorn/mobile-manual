                  To outperform your opponents, you must successfully deploy the potential of your development team in duels for new stories and the best minds. However, things rarely go as planned, as the other players will use every means to secure the best story cards for themselves.

                  In short: For the cards that bring victory points, team members are assigned face down. The team members have different strengths (dice). Effects can be played before and after rolling to gain an advantage. The team with the highest dice result wins the story victory point card.

            Event cards can be held in any number in hand and collected over several rounds. Once played, they are consumed and placed under the event card pile.

            A player who passes cannot play event cards. Each card can be played against any player in the pitch (who has not passed), including oneself. They cannot be played against the pitch card in the center of the table to alter it.
