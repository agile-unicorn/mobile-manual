# Introduction to Agile Unicorn

## Objective of the Game

**Survive the IT chaos with your startup and be the first to win the most victory points.**

To beat your opponents, you must effectively use the potential of your development team in duels for new stories and the best minds. Unfortunately, things rarely go as planned, as the other players will also be using their possible means to secure the best stories for themselves.

!!! success "Winner"
The winner is the player who is the first to reach the agreed number of victory points.

## Game Process

The game consists of several rounds (sprints): A sprint consists of up to 5 duel rounds (pitches). During a sprint, players try to outperform each other by playing their team and event cards to win the most valuable new cards for their startup.

!!! info "TLDR"
Team members are secretly assigned cards that grant victory points. The team members have different strengths (dice). Effects cards can be played before and after rolling to gain an advantage. The team with the highest dice result wins the story victory point card.

## The Cards

There are four different types of cards. They are differentiated by their card color. For the rules, the card texts are not important; only the numbers and symbols in the top left matter.

### Stories (Victory Points)

Stories provide 3 to 20 victory points corresponding to the number in the top left of the card.

Whether a story can be successfully executed is determined by rolling against its value. On success, the player with the highest dice result wins the story card and displays it face up at the end of the sprint along with their other won story cards.

### Team Members

You can only win cards with team members. Their strength is indicated by dice and possibly a bonus or penalty in the top left.

Your team can consist of a maximum of 5 members. If a 6th member is won, the player must dismiss one of their choice and place it in the draw pile.

The team members remain in hand until used (once per sprint).

### Incentives

Incentives can be used after rolling to improve the result. The value in the top left is added to the dice result.

Incentives are kept hidden in hand and are consumed after use for the sprint.

### Event Cards

![Event Card](lovable-uploads/event.png){ align=right width=150 }

Event cards have various effects and can be played before rolling. Some are targeted at specific players, others at all players in the pitch.

The card text describes the effect. Some cards have a **magic wand symbol** (⚡) - these can cancel the effect of the last played event card.

Event cards are discarded after use and cannot be reused until the next sprint.

!!! warning "Important"
Event cards cannot be used to modify the pitch card in the center of the table.
