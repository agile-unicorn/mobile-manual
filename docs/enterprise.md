Enterprise Ecstasy is a separately available expansion of the base game and allows you to play Agile Unicorn with **up to 6 players** and introduces **new tactical elements**. It is not a standalone game.

With 6 players, the game time increases, which is why there are stronger incentives and more valuable stories in the deck. The cards of the expansion deck complement the cards of the base game, meaning they are shuffled together with the others. They have a marking to distinguish them from the other cards and to be able to sort them out if needed.

## New Mechanics

### Reroll

**Incentive to reroll dice**

Rerolls can be used for yourself or against an opponent to repeat a complete **roll of all dice**. Tip: Remember to take your reroll card back after the sprint.

!!! tip "Take back the reroll"
    Remember to take back your player reroll cards after the pitch and to put them on your personal stack.

### The Bomb

### All In

### Sabotage

**Steal incentive**

An incentive can be permanently stolen from an opponent's hand. The opponent holds the incentives face down and the player who played the sabotage card draws one of the cards. Used incentives cannot be stolen.

## Game Setup
