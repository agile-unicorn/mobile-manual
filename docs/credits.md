# Enterprise Ecstasy (Expansion)

## Highly Professional in the Corporation

Enterprise Ecstasy is a separately available expansion for the base game and allows you to play Agile Unicorn with **up to 6 players**, introducing **new tactical elements**.

With 6 players, the game duration increases, so stronger incentives and more valuable stories are included in the deck. The cards from the expansion deck complement the cards from the base game, meaning they are shuffled together. They are marked to distinguish them from the other cards and can be sorted out if needed.

## New Mechanics

### Reroll

![Reroll](./lovable-uploads/reroll.png){ align=left width=100 }

**Incentive to reroll**

Rerolls can be used for yourself or against another player to **reroll all dice**. After use, the card is consumed for the sprint.

### The Bomb

![Bomb](./lovable-uploads/bomb.png){ align=left width=100 }

**Event to cancel the pitch**

The entire pitch is canceled, and all used cards are consumed. This card affects all players who participated in the pitch.

### All In

**Event to use all team members**

All remaining team members must be used in the pitch.

### Sabotage

![Sabotage](./lovable-uploads/sabotage.png){ align=left width=100 }

**Steal an incentive**

An incentive can be permanently stolen from another player's hand. The player keeps their incentives hidden, and the player who played the sabotage card draws one of them. Used incentives cannot be stolen.

## Game Setup

### Sort Cards

The cards from the expansion deck are shuffled into the base game cards, except for the following:

- One reroll card is set aside for each player for the starting deck. Additional reroll cards are shuffled into the draw pile.
- All CTOs and noobs not needed by the players are removed from the game.
- The rest of the setup proceeds as in the base game.

### Distribute Starting Deck

Each player receives the following cards:

- one Chief Technical Officer (CTO, 3 dice)
- one team member with 2 dice
- one noob (1 die)
- one green reroll incentive card
- one green incentive card with a value of 2
- two event cards
