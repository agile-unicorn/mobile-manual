# The Sprint

![Sprint Overview](images/sprint.png)

The game runs over multiple sprints: A sprint consists of up to 5 duel rounds (pitches). During a sprint, players try to outperform their opponents in several duels by playing their team and event cards to win the most valuable new cards for their startup.

## Sprint Start

All players have their complete team as well as any incentive cards in their hand. If event cards are used, they are also in hand.

## Sprint Backlog

The content of the sprint is determined by laying out a sprint backlog of 5 random cards drawn from the draw pile (stories, incentives, team cards). The first card is placed face up in the center of the table, the next one as a preview next to the remaining cards (which are still face down). This is followed by several pitch rounds for the sprint backlog cards.

## Sprint End

The sprint ends as soon as the last pitch round has been played. It may also end prematurely if all players have used their team cards or have passed. If only one player still has unused team cards in hand, they can continue the remaining pitches alone. However, if they pass, the sprint is over.

## Retro and New Sprint

Each player ensures that their team consists of a maximum of 5 members. Extra team cards are placed back in the draw pile.

All team cards as well as new and used incentive cards are retrieved. Each player draws two new event cards; unused ones remain in hand. The sprint backlog is replenished from the draw pile (5 cards, or 6 cards with 5 players) and the next starting player begins the new sprint.
