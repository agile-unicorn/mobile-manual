1.  What is a Unicorn? A unicorn is a private startup company that has reached a valuation of over one billion US dollars. The term was coined to emphasize the rarity of such successes, as it is very difficult for startups to achieve such a valuation (unless in a bubble).

To outmaneuver your fellow players, you must successfully deploy your development team's potential in the duel for new stories and the best minds. But unfortunately, things rarely go as planned, as other players will also resort to all means to win the best stories for themselves.

    

!!! example "TLDR - How does the game work?"
    Team members are secretly assigned to the cards that bring victory points. The team members have different strengths (dice). Effects can be played before and after rolling to gain an advantage. The team with the highest dice result gets the story victory point card.
