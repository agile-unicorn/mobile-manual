!!! tip "What is a Unicorn?"
A unicorn is a private startup company that has reached a valuation of over one billion US dollars. The term was coined to emphasize the rarity of such successes, as it is very difficult for startups to achieve such a valuation (unless in a bubble).

## Quick Start

**Objective:** Survive the IT chaos with your startup and be the first to win the most victory points.

**TLDR:** Team members are secretly assigned cards that grant victory points. The team members have different strengths (dice). Effects cards can be played before and after rolling to gain an advantage. The team with the highest dice result wins the story victory point card.
